# Scales

Where it makes sense, and compared with other libraries, Hucssley favours a millennial scale (`0` - `1000`) to represent values instead of “names” like `xxl`, `mama-bear` etc. This can of course be completely customized.

By default, the following classes use a millennial scale:

* `background-color`
* `border-color`
* `border-radius`
* `border-width`
* `color`
* `font-size`
* `letter-spacing`
* `line-height`
* `margin`
* `padding`
* `transition-delay`
* `transition-duration`

While others, like `opacity` and `scale` use values more relevant to your conceptual model.
